\section*{Abstract}

When a person decides to try skateboarding for themselves, often times, they quit before they have
even learned their first trick. Our app wants to reveal the vast number of skateparks Tyrol has to
offer, so that new skaters can try them out and maybe find new friends there, motivating them to
keep going, which will support the local skateboarding community. \\

It is possible for skaters to give their own opinion about the parks and rate them accordingly.
With the help of these ratings new skaters can look for popular parks way more easily.
Alternatively it is possible to sort the skateparks by the distance to find the ones which are
nearest. \\

When the skaters know a location which is not available in the database, they can submit a
suggestion. This suggestion can be viewed by admins. The admins can then make changes to this
proposal and add it as a park or delete it.\\
