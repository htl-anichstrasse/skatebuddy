\section*{Abstract}

New skaters often have no information about the local parks or do not even know how many
skateparks there are in Tyrol. Many stop skateboarding before they even learn their first trick. 
In the app as well as on the website we want to give them a quick overview of the parks 
in the vicinity, so that new skaters can try them out and maybe meet new friends who will motivate them to continue 
and not to give up.\\

It is possible for skaters to give their own opinion about the parks and rate them accordingly. 
With the help of these ratings new skaters can look for popular parks way more easily. 
Alternatively it is possible to sort the skateparks by the distance to find the ones which are 
closer more easily. \\

When the skaters know a location which is not available on the application server, they can 
add it as a suggestion. This suggestion can be viewed by admins. The admins 
can then make changes to this proposal and add it as a park or delete it.\\
