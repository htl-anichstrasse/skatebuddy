\section*{Abstract}

When a person decides to try skateboarding for themselves, often times, they quit before they have even learned their first trick. Our app wants to reveal the vast number of skateparks Tyrol has to offer, so that new skaters can try them out and maybe find new friends there, motivating them to keep going, which will support the local skateboarding community.
